Depression is the most common of mood disorders, and its effects on those who suffer from it can be severe. However, when we break down depression by the symptoms that characterize it, early detection begins to seem increasingly possible.

The application below implements a natural language processing model to classify spoken language; using machine learning to return a probability of input being indicative of depression. For more information on depression, feel free to visit the [National Institute for Mental Healthâ€™s website](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml).
